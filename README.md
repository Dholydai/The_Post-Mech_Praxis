# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.

_This keyboard is hardwired... plug-n-play. It works with the US-English drivers of Windows and Linux._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Released the Rev 2 keyboard case files. The added screwed fasteners make it very solid. I call it "The Slab."

1. DO NOT BUILD Rev 2: I am tweaking the two-handed design. I must remake the PCB in total with KiCad to create an editable file. Adding a 92nd switch will make finding a keycap set 50 times easier.

2. GET THE PCB WRAPPED IN A CASE BEFORE FIRING IT UP: Static discharge has damaged several controllers on my bare boards. On very rare occasion #1 exhibits flakey output that is by solved by hot-plugging. Suspect static damage.

3. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE: I did not trim the leads of switch K8 flush with the PCB. The long lead shorted the switch to ground through the USB-C connector. The brand new Elite-C controller was killed on first power-up.

4. TO REPLACE THE CONTROLLER: Desolder the Elite-C as best you can (you must buy an electric desoldering sucker). Carefully break up the little PCB with needle nose pliers, being careful to avoid twisting the headers. Desolder and remove the torn pieces of through-hole barrels stuck to the header pins. Solder the new controller to the old headers.

Note: Received new Rev 2 PCBs from PCBWay for two-hand keyboards, the quality of the PCBs is excellent... built #4. Also built and tested the reversable PCBs for single-hand Dvorak keyboards designed by Troy Fletcher. Both work!
