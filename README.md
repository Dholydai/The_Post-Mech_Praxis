# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.

_This keyboard is hardwired... plug-n-play. It works with the US-English drivers of Windows and Linux._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Released the Rev 2 keyboard case files. The added screwed fasteners make it very solid. I call it "The Slab."

Note: Received new Rev 2 PCBs from PCBWay for two-hand keyboards, and the reversable PCBs for single-hand Dvorak keyboards. Now building #4. The quality of the PCB is excellent.
