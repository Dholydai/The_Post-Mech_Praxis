# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... designed for children born in the third decade of the 21st century.

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD.
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher.

Action Item #1: the missing gerber and hole files will be added soon.
Action Item #2: the through holes for the Cherry stabs are too narrow, I file them out. The USB port is a bit wonky.
Action Item #3: some case bottom dimensions are too long on X (likely several instances) keeping the case top joints from butting up.

PS: The joints on the 200 mm bp three piece top are tight and strong. The 300 mm bp case top has a weaker joint, and the big part distorts when printed with ASA (too rectangular).
