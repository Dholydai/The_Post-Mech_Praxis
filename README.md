# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... designed for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD.
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Item #1: Found a flaw in the PCB design that is my fault. Removed the KiCad folder.
//Item #2: The USB port is a bit wonky.
//Item #3: Some case bottom dimensions are too long on X by tenths of a mm, keeping the case top joints from butting up.

PS: The joints on the 200 mm bp three piece case top are tight and strong. The 300 mm bp top has a weaker joint, and the big part distorts when printed with ASA.
