# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.

_This keyboard is hardwired... plug-n-play. It works with the US-English drivers of Windows and Linux._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Released the Rev 2 keyboard case files. The added screwed fasteners make it very solid. I call it "The Slab."

1. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL KEYBOARD: Get it wrapped in a case before firing it up. Static discharge to a PCB will damage the controller. On very rare occasion flakey output has been a problem. That is usually solved by hot-plugging, or rebooting the PC.

2. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE: I did not trim the leads of switch K8 flush with the PCB. The long lead shorted the switch to ground through the USB-C connector. The brand new Elite-C controller was killed on first power-up.

3. TO REPLACE THE CONTROLLER: Desolder the Elite-C as best you can. Carefully break up the little PCB with needle nose pliers, being careful to avoid twisting the headers. Desolder and remove the torn piecess of through-hole barrels stuck to the header pins. Solder the new controller to the old headers.

Note: Received new Rev 2 PCBs from PCBWay for two-hand keyboards, he quality of the PCBs is excellent... now building #4. Also received the reversable PCBs for single-hand Dvorak keyboards designed by Troy Fletcher.

The two-hand Post-Mech keyboard PCB is available for purchase from PCBWay in lots of five: Part Number
