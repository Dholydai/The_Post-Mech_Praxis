# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.
_These designs are ISO compliant._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Item #1: Fixed the wonky USB port. Files to be released soon.
//Item #2: Adding mechanical joints to fix all of the case sections together with screws. Files to be released soon.

18 Jan 2024: ASA fumes have become intollerable despite many precautions. Having difficulty finding a non-toxic filament to make screw-fixed keyboard cases. Prints on my Voron Trident 350 using structurally enhanced PLA are (or seem to be) dimensionally challanged. Reprinting the top sections on my Prusa Mk3s+ printer.

Note: There is a reversable PCB design in the KiCad folder for single-hand Dvorak keyboards. Never built, programmed, or tested. I have received the PCBs.
