# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. In "Image" there is a photo of the ribs that strengthen the underside of the case top! 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave In "KiCad" there is a reversable PCB for left or right Dvorak!

//Item #1: The USB port is a bit wonky. Fix that soon.
//Item #2: Some case bottom dimensions are too long on X by tenths of a mm, keeping the case top joints from butting up. Fix that real soon.

PS: The joints on the 200 mm bp three piece case top are tight and strong. The 300 mm bp top has a weaker joint, and the big part distorts when printed with ASA.

Missed my New Years deadline. A less stressful pace is adopted. Have a new goal of finishing before Feb 2024.
