# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.
_These designs are ISO compliant._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Item #1: The USB port is a bit wonky. Fix that soon.
//Item #2: Currently adding butt joints to mechanically fix the case bottom halves together with screws. Finish soon.

Note: There is a reversable PCB design in the KiCad folder for single-hand Dvorak keyboards. Good job Troy!
