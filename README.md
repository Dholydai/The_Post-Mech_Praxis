# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.
_This keyboard design is ISO compliant. The Post-Mech is going to be cordially received in Europe._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. In "Image" there is a photo of the ribs that strengthen the underside of the case top! 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave In "KiCad" there is a reversable PCB for left or right Dvorak!

//Item #1: The USB port is a bit wonky. Fix that soon.
//Item #2: Currently adding butt joints to mechanically fix the case bottom halves together with screws. Finish soon.

PS: The joints on the 200 mm bp three piece case top are tight and strong. The 300 mm bp top has a weaker joint, and the big part distorts when printed with ASA (scaled at %100.7 for shrinkage).
