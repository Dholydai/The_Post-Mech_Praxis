# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.
_These designs are ISO compliant._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Item #1: Fixed the wonky USB port. Files to be released soon.
//Item #2: Added mechanical joints to fix all of the case sections together with screws. Files to be released soon.
