# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... for writers born in the third decade of the 21st century.
_These designs are ISO compliant._  

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD. 
The PCB design and controller program were created by Troy Fletcher: https://github.com/TroyFletcher/vim-colors-synthwave

//Released the Rev 2 keyboard case files, which fixed the wonky USB port and added screwed fasteners to the various sections. I call it "The Slab."

18 Jan 2024: ASA fumes have become intollerable despite many precautions. Decided to add mechanical connections to the case so everyone can use non-toxic 3D printing filament.

Note: Received new Rev 2 PCBs for two-hand keyboards, and the reversable PCBs for single-hand Dvorak keyboards. The quality of PCBWay's products is excellent.
