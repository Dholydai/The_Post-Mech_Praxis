# The_Post-Mech_Praxis
The "post-mechanical typewriter mechanical switch keyboard"... designed for children born in the third decade of the 21st century.

The cases were created using https://github.com/jeffminton/keyboard_stl_generator and OpenSCAD.
The PCB design and controller programming were created by Troy Fletcher.

KB_Stl_Gen: files to create the cases using keyboard-stl-generator. Includes files for my single-hand keyboards.
KiCad:      the PCB design files (see action item #1 below).
PMK:        the .hex file needed to program the Elite-C micro-controller (transparent to Qwerty... PnP).
SCAD:       files generated by keyboard_stl_generator for case tops (see action item #2 below). Dholydai designed the case bottoms.
Stl:        files for 3D printing cases (for 200 mm or 300 mm build plate size)

Action Item #1: the missing gerber file will be added soon.
Action Item #2: the through holes for the Cherry stabs are too narrow, I file them out. The USB port is a bit wonky. I will try to fix those problems.

PS: The joints on the 200 mm bp three piece top are tight and strong. The 300 mm bp case top has a weaker joint, and the big part distorts when printed with ASA (too rectanguler).
