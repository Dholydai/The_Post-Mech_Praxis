Files for 3D printer slicing programs:

1. The case top files (created using Keyboard Stl Generator) have hundreds of small flaws. PrusaSlicer or SuperSlicer have a "right click to repair with Netfab" feature that must be used. Slicing without repairing first is impossible. The bad behavior of unrepaired files is quickly apparent in the slicer program.

2. Cases can be printed using many 3D printing materials. Suitable materials do shrink and warp when cooled. Tolerences are tight around the key switches, that shrinkage must be compensated for by "scaling" the print up a tiny bit.

3. Added mechanical connections to the case bottom halves and and case top sections. Have used PETG and PLA Meta to print cases.

4. Scaling up the next PLA Meta stl files to 100.3% in the slicer hoping that will be correct to counter the shrinkage.

5. Stl files for the 300 build plate case are not given. The smaller 200 BP case is much better.

Conclusion: Adding the screwed connectors produced a case that I call "The Slab."
